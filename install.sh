# Noiz Console (noiz-dark) — ISPConfig theme deploy helper.
# Installs the theme by symlinking (default) or copying themes/noiz-dark
# into an ISPConfig install, and stamps the theme's `ispconfig_version`
# file to EXACTLY match the install's ISPC_APP_VERSION.
# Touches NOTHING in ISPConfig core.
#
# Why the stamp matters: ISPConfig gates themes by an EXACT version match.
#   - interface/web/login/index.php  resets a user's theme to 'default' at login
#     unless themes/<t>/ispconfig_version EXISTS and equals ISPC_APP_VERSION.
#   - tools/form/user_settings.tform.php only lists a theme in the Design picker
#     when it has no version file OR the file equals ISPC_APP_VERSION.
# The only state that satisfies BOTH is: file present AND == ISPC_APP_VERSION.
# That value is install-specific and changes on upgrade, so we stamp it here
# (and you re-run this after a major ISPConfig upgrade).
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh [--copy] [ISPCONFIG_ROOT]
#     ISPCONFIG_ROOT defaults to /usr/local/ispconfig
#     --copy   copy the theme instead of symlinking (use for packaged installs)
#

Done. Next steps:

  1. Per user:    Tools > User Settings > Design > select "noiz-dark" > Save,
                  then LOG OUT AND BACK IN (the theme is applied at login).
  2. System wide + login screen — set in interface/lib/config.inc.php (update-safe):

       $conf['theme'] = 'noiz-dark';

     (server/lib/config.inc.php's theme does NOT affect the web UI — interface only.)

  3. Hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) — the CSS is cache-busted with ?ver=2.

After a MAJOR ISPConfig upgrade, re-run this script so ispconfig_version is
re-stamped to the new ISPC_APP_VERSION (otherwise the theme silently reverts to
default at login), and diff the two shell templates against the new stock ones.

No ISPConfig core file was modified.
